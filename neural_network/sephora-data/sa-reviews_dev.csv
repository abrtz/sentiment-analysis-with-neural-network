"I like this eye mask. It seems a bit thick but melts into the skin.  maybe those believing it to be too thick are following the outright ridiculous instructions.

Third, and last point, about that jar and the box it came in. I have never seen a worse example of excess packaging. The jar is small the box is at least twice its size. Then looking at the jar, the image doesn’t show it but jar in hand the portion of the jar that actually holds product is about 60% at best.

"This is the first exfoliant I’ve used that hasn’t made me breakout, or caused my skin to react badly. It’s coarse, but once it hits wet skin it scrubs and hydrates at the same time. It feels almost lotiony in a way. It’s unscented and you can really control how much exfoliant you need in specific areas. For instance, when I use most exfoliants they are in a gel or soap and it can be hard to use more or less on dryer areas.

"I ordered this as soon as it was available in Canada, after seeing a US influencer hyper it up. Now I won’t say this isn’t some kind of miracle cream, but it did help.I have some pretty pale skin... I’m talking porcelain shades are often not the right match. I have cool undertones and struggle with hormonal acne -- needless to say, my face is often more pink than my neck and shoulders, so I was looking for an easier way to even our my tone *without* using makeup. The SPF was a bigtime bonus, especially since I use topical tretinoin (retinoid).My guess (when it comes to the reviews saying not to use this on pale skin) is that they simply were using too much product?? I can only speak from my own experience, but I used this cream sparingly (a dab on each cheek, my chin & forehand - then rubbing it all in) and I didn’t have the same issue with my face turning a few shades too dark. It definitely colour-shifts -- for example, I have a couple of dry patches where pimples are healing and the product settled into those patches a little, and it looks like a tinted moisturizer or light foundation -- I also noticed the product under my nails after scratching my forehead and it looked like I had scraped foundation off my face -- but I didn’t use any kind of setting powder, and I feel like that would help a lot. The finish is very dewy and my skin is combination/oily so a setting powder would do the trick for me, I think, to mattify and keep everything in place -- easy enough fix.Overall, at this stage I’d give this treatment a 3.5/5 -- I’m not sure how it’ll layer under makeup, but on it’s own, it’s not bad, not bad.",1.0,3,order soon available canada see u influencer hyper wont say isnt kind miracle cream helpi pretty pale skin im talk porcelain shade often right match cool undertone struggle hormonal acne needless say face often pink neck shoulder look easy way even tone without use makeup spf bigtime bonus especially since use topical tretinoin retinoidmy guess come review say use pale skin simply use much product speak experience use cream sparingly dab cheek chin forehand rub didnt issue face turn shade dark definitely colourshifts example couple dry patch pimple heal product settle patch little look like tinted moisturizer light foundation also notice product nail scratch forehead look like scrap foundation face didnt use kind set powder feel like would help lot finish dewy skin combinationoily set powder would trick think mattify keep everything place easy enough fixoverall stage id give treatment im sure itll layer makeup bad bad

I started with every other night, but I’ve been using it  nightly now for 2-3 weeks with no issues.

I had a skin purge when I first started using it. I had more breakouts and they were worse than usual. I stuck with it, and now the results are paying off. My skin has never looked better. My face is so soft and radiant. My breakouts are far less often, much less severe, and have been clearing up faster. I hate that it’s definitely on the pricey side, but if I can’t swing the $90 for the full size I can always grab the NightBright set to get me through the month! AMAZING product.

I’ve been looking for ways to cut the cost of my skincare routine and when I saw hyaluronic acid for only $7 I figured you can’t go wrong with at least trying that. I have used different HA type serums for hydration by other companies (caudalie and drunk elephant) and found them to be really awesome adds. They add so much moisture and bounce to your skin and help the products on top go a bit further. That was not my experience with The Ordinary’s HA. Ordinary’s HA tightened and dried my skin (literally the opposite of what HA should do?!). And I couldn’t put any products on top of this without the HA pealing and rolling off on my face with little chunks everywhere... gross.I firmly believe that everybody’s skin is different so my experience might not be the same as yours.

"I was very excited to try this Charlotte Tilbury Magic cream moisturizer because I have heard so many great things about it. I was skeptical because I’ve tried so many different kinds.

"This was my first time using retinol. I’ve got some leftover pigmentation from breakouts and with my olive skin tone, they just never go away. I stepped up my use of this as recommended, from once a week to a few times a week to every other day, then nightly. Be very careful when using this product. I’ve used it and gone for a brow wax and had my skin ripped off. Although it recovered using Polysporin, you can’t go for a wax within 10 days of using retinol, which includes even one minimal application. In the beginning, I noticed a “purge” of my pores where my skin got worse than it was, but cleared up again. I am using it to get rid of the leftover pigmentation, and so far it is doing a great job. It has also flattened my raised bumps. It also has my skin looking rather clear and fresh upon waking and as a result I’ve barely been using my masks which I used to use every day. A tip: don’t scrub your skin with any type of exfoliant while using this product. It will make your skin very sensitive. Also, use only a pea size amount as directed. Don’t overdo it because it will make your skin unnecessarily sensitive. I actually use a moisturizer after it to prevent drying, which works well.

I am rating this so poorly for many reasons. The packaging feels like an expensive toothpaste tube but nevertheless like a toothpaste tube. For the price I expect better packaging. The smell is overpowering and lingers even if you wash the product away. The formula is extremely thick to a point where it feels like Vaseline on the skin. I followed as instructed and blotted my face after 10 minutes. The mask did not sink into the skin but instead sat on top of the skin. After an hour of doing the mask my face got extremely hot and turned red. I had to wash the product off. Even after being washed away it took my skin a few hours to return to normal.

"This sunscreen is mediocre at best. I bought because of how many people raved about it. I have this one and the glow screen. The glow screen product is 5 STARS I absolutely love it.

"This is a nice and more affordable first cleanser if you double cleanse as part of your routine. I can even use it on its own on my no-makeup days if I’m just lounging at home, or when my skin gets more dry and sensitive during winter or when I’m going through PMS (I get hives and dry patches that don’t cooperate with my usual water-based cleanser for combo skin). It’s quite thick though so it might take some getting used to if you usually use foamy or gel cleansers, and you need to use enough water so you’re not pulling on your skin when moving the product around. I just wish it could break down waterproof mascara better. Like I said it’s thick and feels almost tacky, so it’s hard to even rub it around the eye area without tugging on my eyelids or lashes (and it definitely will not dissolve the mascara if you just pat and let the product sit like cleansing oils or even the Farmacy cleansing balm).

I really like this product but the glass bottle itself is frustrating.

"Okay so I am always VERY skeptical of all skincare products and never trust anything. I also only use natural things on my face and even though I genetically have pretty good skin, almost every product I put on my face makes me break out. Recently, I have been getting pimples and dry skin from wearing masks all day and this product made them go away over night. I am not even exaggerating. I bought this only because it said it helps with firming skin but I didn’t plan on it helping to get rid of pimples and to work so quick. I also had some scarring from picking at my face a lot and those went away. I was still skeptical after that wondering if it was just a coincidence but yesterday I got some pimples from eating a ton of salty and sweet food so I tried using this over night and they are almost all gone! It usually takes my skin about a week for them to go away naturally if I drink a ton of water. So now I truly believe this works. My friends even noticed that my skin has a slight glow to it now and it looks smoother and more even. My skin even lightened back up after getting so tanned over summer (I have a brown skin tone btw - don’t know if that is useful information). The hyperpigmentation around my mouth lightened up a bit too. Oh and yeah my skin looks firmer and less wrinkly on my forehead so that part seems true too. So I definitely recommend this! Although, I read that you shouldn’t use this with other acidic products and some face cleansers and moisturizers are acidic, so be careful about that. I only use coconut oil as my moisturizer and sunscreen (don’t know if that is useful info as well).",1.0,5,okay always skeptical skincare product never trust anything also use natural thing face even though genetically pretty good skin almost every product put face make break recently get pimple dry skin wear mask day product make go away night even exaggerate buy say helps firm skin didnt plan help get rid pimple work quick also scar pick face lot go away still skeptical wonder coincidence yesterday get pimple eat ton salty sweet food try use night almost go usually take skin week go away naturally drink ton water truly believe work friend even notice skin slight glow look smoother even skin even lighten back get tan summer brown skin tone btw dont know useful information hyperpigmentation around mouth lighten bit oh yeah skin look firm less wrinkly forehead part seem true definitely recommend although read shouldnt use acidic product face cleanser moisturizers acidic careful use coconut oil moisturizer sunscreen dont know useful info well

"I’ve had dark circles for as long as I can remember and nothing has seemed to cure them. Since this didn’t either I’m inclined to believe they’re not caused by hyperpigmentation but perhaps a shadow or loss of fat under the eyelid.

Now that I have been using this for about month, I can truly attest that the eye bomb does everything Belif says it does. I noticed on the first time using it, it visibly smooths, evens, and firms my under eye area. My mother and I tried out the product upon first arrival, and noticed the effects immediately--for context, she’s 47 and I am 23. In the morning, I also use this, as it fuels moisture straight into that area through its crazy fast absorption rate (which is quite surprising as it is quite rich in texture). My skin drinks this up, so much so, that it creates a fine base for foundation and concealer. It works so well with my Laura Mercier Concealer and I have never (NEVER) had issues of creasing or dry patches. More importantly, my eyes look as if I’ve gotten 8 hours of sleep and my skin looks as if I drink more than the recommended daily amount of water. On nights when I’ve had no sleep, it helps with reducing the apparent tiredness. Honestly, as a person who has NEVER really used an eye cream before, I was surprised by how seamlessly this product became part of my daily routine. .

"Amazing. The texture of this gel is superb. Drier than lotions or creams, and a heavier weight (inside the jar). But when it “melts,” I can almost feel the dry skin under my eyes simply relax.The heavier consistency is easy to handle, no mess and no migrating into my eyes. (Contact lens wearers) At first use, instant results. Big improvement of puffiness and under-eye bags, dark circles, and satiny smooth hydration for fragile, aging skin. It has a high-quality, luxurious feel and right-now results.It was a little deflating that it does NOT come with Tatcha’s signature Gold Spatula on top. Just a sort of 3-D image of a blooming peony inside the lid. But the logic of recycling the spoons you may already have is clear enough. Silk Peony does have a nice, quiet, spa-like scent that’s not too strong and hasn’t triggered any allergies or eye sensitivity.This cream is just delicious to my skin, which actually does feel smooth as silk around my eyes. Hope to see other benefits soon, like faded age spots or tightened/lifted eyelids. It’s also reasonably priced, unlike most other Tatcha products, and this little tub full of joy should last months, even applying it twice daily.Because I’m childish, I knocked one star off for the loss of Tatcha’s trademark Golden Spatula.

"I have loved Drunk Elephant products in the past. As someone who has incredibly sensitive skin, I have tried A LOT of moisturizers, trying to find the right one for my skin. The product itself is alright, definitely not for incredibly dry skin, but the reason for my three stars is the ridiculous amount of product you get for that price tag!!! Within two weeks, I was having a problem getting product out of the pump and managed to get the plastic pump lid off the product only to see that the GIANT jar this comes in literally is sealed off with a 2 inch plastic tub that actually holds the product you are actually getting. The size of the jar is completely and entirely misleading, which I found infuriating. To spend that kind of money and only receive what appears to be the likes of a large sample made this become a product I will NEVER purchase again.

As I received a sample of this, I like the squeeze tube it is in, but as I watch beauty influencers and see advertising it shows this product in a jar. Jars like this for primers and skin care like this allow it to be more prone for bacteria as you ha e to scoop in each time.

"This is a great vitamin C serum. The type of Vitamin C used is more stable and lasts longer than the ascorbic acid used in others, which means when mixed with other ingredients or when sunlight interacts with it, it’s able to hold on to its chemical integrity better.

I like to use this in the morning but it does make me look a bit shiny for a couple hours after I apply.

"to save you from reading this lengthy review, it’s good, kinda pricey, left a whiteish cast at first but went away (just keep patting it in), and it’s buildable! so originally i was going to get this in store, but they only had the original size (which i was not going to pay for), so i got it delivered at my house for the mini. i got this for redness that’s very prominent on my cheeks and when i tried it, it wasn’t full coverage. i wasn’t really expecting my skin to be absolutely flawless, but i can still see some redness, but it definitely reduced it! so my final verdict is that its pretty good! if you want more coverage, just build it on, i applied very little product when i tried it. i will say, this product is aimed for those who have light/fair skin. i don’t really know what my skin tone is because i have the worst mask tan line. my forehead is pretty tan, but the rest of my face is light-medium haha. oh and it kinda looks like it left a white-ish cast in my face but i checked again about 4 hours later and it didn’t seem like that, just keep patting it into the skin! thanks for reading this review! writing reviews is quite relaxing.^ btw sorry i don’t have pictures of it on :/",1.0,4,save read lengthy review good kinda pricey leave whiteish cast first go away keep pat buildable originally go get store original size go pay get deliver house mini get redness thats prominent cheek try wasnt full coverage wasnt really expect skin absolutely flawless still see redness definitely reduce final verdict pretty good want coverage build apply little product try say product aim lightfair skin dont really know skin tone worst mask tan line forehead pretty tan rest face lightmedium haha oh kinda look like left whiteish cast face check hour later didnt seem like keep patting skin thanks read review write review quite relax btw sorry dont picture

I would say this is probably my second favorite moisturizer next to Kate Sommerville. I have pretty sensitive skin so it can be hard to find products that work for me.

The reviews are all true. This product is awesome! I got the vanilla - it has a very mild scent and basically no flavour which are pros to me. I do what the directions say- apply generously for overnight use. When I wake up in the morning there’s just a tiny bit left on my lips and they look and feel amazing. I am the type of person that before using this product had tried every single inexpensive lip balm ever. Then finally I decided to pony up and pay a little extra for something good. I don’t regret it one bit. My lips used to chap all over the bottom lip. Skin is naturally supposed to come off but my lips would never let go and it would peel off painfully- causing me always to be biting my lips and not in a cute way. The first two days with this my bottom lip skin was definitely flaking off but it came off completely painlessly and I haven’t had any of that since. Ordered on the 27th in the evening and my package arrived on the 31st. I’ve used it every day since (6 days total).,1.0,5,review true product awesome get vanilla mild scent basically flavour pro direction say apply generously overnight use wake morning there tiny bit leave lips look feel amazing type person use product try every single inexpensive lip balm ever finally decide pony pay little extra something good dont regret one bit lip use chap bottom lip skin naturally suppose come lip would never let go would peel painfully cause always bite lip cute way first two day bottom lip skin definitely flake come completely painlessly havent since order th even package arrive st ive use every day since day total

"FIRMx Peeling Gel is not new to the skincare world, and it remains an awesome “fix“ for smoothing skin (face, hands, legs, feet) and clearing pores. If you want a once-in-a-lifetime self tan, use this to exfoliate before applying your tanner. For facial use, once clear of the dead skin barrier, all of your expensive serums and creams will absorb. It may not be that your serum is not working; it very well could be dead skin keeping your serum from absorbing. Some reviews say it is a hoax because if you use it two times in a row, you get the same collection of peel-off, and that is true. However, in the first application the color of the peel-off is grayish and if you immediately repeat the application, it’s the same amount of peel-off, but since there is no dead skin left, the color is white, not gray. This amazing product is the real deal and I pray at every use, that PTR does not retire this phenomenal star.",1.0,5,firmx peel gel new skincare world remain awesome fix smooth skin face hand legs foot clear pore want onceinalifetime self tan use exfoliate apply tanner facial use clear dead skin barrier expensive serum cream absorb may serum work well could dead skin keep serum absorb review say hoax use two time row get collection peeloff true however first application color peeloff grayish immediately repeat application amount peeloff since dead skin leave color white gray amazing product real deal pray every use ptr retire phenomenal star

My skin feels hydrated and healthy. I even feel like it helps soften the fine lines I get in my forehead.

Anyhow, I’m still aiming to use up this product because there is a lot of it left and I don’t plan on returning it because it took 2 weeks to get to me because of our p8ndemic situation so to work with the product (as opposed to, against it) I started using a very hydrating moisturizer (I have dry skin) underneath this sunscreen, which offsets the grey-ness a bit.

"*disclaimer I received this product for free for testing purposes*2.5 start really but I can’t award .5 and I don’t think it’s deserves 3.. So 2 stars.. This product is extremely similar to the hydro boost water gel from Neutrogena in the sense they’re both silicone based. However this $50 product contains “alcohol denat” very early on in the list of ingredients. Thos is a normal alcohol with an additive that makes it so humans won’t want to consume it. It’s great for things like acting as a solvent helping thing dissolve and creating a fast absorbing formula however at the end of the day it’s alcohol. Over time it dries the skin out and possibly damage the skin barrier and cause inflammation and don’t no one want that in their face.

Had to give it a try to see if it was worth the hype.  I’ve been using nivea creme for the past month to help with very dry winter skin and have loved the feel and results.  I find both a tad on the thick side which creates a lot of tugging on the skin unless you have the patience to pat on your moisturizer.  I’ve been adding about 4 drops of kiehls midnight repair serum  (another must have) and it really helps to thin it out enough for a smoother application (highly recommend).  And in 100% honesty after having tried both I prefer the nivea creme.  When it dries it doesn’t leave a residue on my skin which I found la mer does and makes it hard to apply makeup on.  And the other obvious con is the price.  Other then that these products are practically identical right down to the scent.  I am honestly shocked so many people would choose la mer over nivea.

"I absolutely adore Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks and foundation, but never tried her skincare line until now. Charlotte’s Magic Cream really lives up to its name. Everything from the box to the glass jar feels luxurious. I loved the fact that there was so much information on the very stylish box, and even the little heart in the corner made it feel so special. I am a sucker for a good packaging. The glass jar itself feels so nice, and it’s a fitting vessel for such an amazing cream! The cream doesn’t have any overwhelming scent, it just smells really clean, if that makes sense. I think because of it’s ingredients and the lack of any fragrance makes it really suitable for any skin type, even sensitive ones. It looks a bit thick at first glance, but as soon as you spread it around onnyour face, it feels really lightweight and my skin just immediately looks glowier. I have stubborn little fine lines on my forehead, and whenever I put on foundation it looked very dry and the lines looked very exaggerated. But with this amazing cream I can see how every subsequent product I put on (sunscreen, primer, foundation and powder) all seem to blend seemlessly, and my face just looks healthy and glowy. I would definitely be purchasing the refills in the future. It’s one of the other things I love about this product - you can but refills and just use the amazing jar as long as you can.

"I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have been using it for a few months and this has been my favorite. The texture is a bit on the heavier side (not a gel-like consistency, more like a heavy whipping cream) and the smell is pleasant. (Similar to French vanilla ice cream.) I love the ingredient list - Ceramides, Squalene and Glycerin. If you have dry skin, this moisturizer is perfect for you. Due to the ceramide content, it locks in moisture into your skin. I feel like the moisturizer gave my face an instant glow. While I love how the moisturizer works, I have to point out one major flaw: the jar. The jar gives an illusion that it is holding more product but it is not. While Sunday Riley claims to be a sustainable company, how is it sustainable to utilize such a thicker jar for their moisturizer?

"I bought the mini marula oil together with the soaps. After two weeks I added TLC framboos to my routine and I ended up with tiny little bumps on my forehead, every each pore became so big. I was thinking it was just purging because of the TLC (my first AHA/BHA ever) so I have waited for another 6 weeks, meanwhile after 4 weeks I contacted the DE customer service with provided photos, they were really nice but told me this usually happens if I had previously used products which contain the suspicious 6 and I need to take a clean break (week or so of using only pekee or beste no.9   marula oil). I also took a clean break before I started using TLC, so I took 2 clean breaks :)) Unfortunately, it was getting worse and worse but I still thought it was the purging. I did not want to go out because of that a felt very frustrated.Then I eventually gave up TLC and used just marula oil   Lala or B-hydra to calm down my skin but there were more pimples every morning. Then I run out of marula oil and I was convinced that I need another one (because it so great, antibacterial and nourishing as I was told!). Luckily it was out of stock so I used only Lala and B-Hydra and my skin started clearing up a little! I had to completely switched my skincare because there is marula oil in every DE product. But it will still take some time recover and have a clear skin :( It may works for somebody but I am acne prone and it just clogged my pores plus it is so expensive.

"I wanted soooo much to love this product and I gave it a good 3 month try. I love all of my other Olehenriksen products so much so I figured this would be a no brainer as I had run out of my regular garnier micellar water. At first this product was amazing and I had no problems with it. It Continued to keep my skin clear! But then over time little bumps would appear on my face. While they weren’t red or white or any other color than my skin, you could tell my skin was uneven and I could feel them any time I touched my face. I also could squeeze them and basically pop them like micropimples! (I know I shouldn’t have but I had to) also my general acne was getting bigger than normal and worse than normal again. And before I had introduced this product my skin had basically cleared for the first time in a long time! But for the life of me I couldn’t figure out what it was. And then slowly it dawned on me that the toner was the problem! Everything else in my skincare and life had stayed the same! Finally about halfway through the product I made the decision to go back to the garnier micellar water just to see if it made a difference. And it did.

This product really washes off your makeup. I normally have to use a makeup wipe first before washing my face but I use this first to dissolve the makeup and then wash my face again quickly with my normal face wash. So I don’t use it as a face wash but more as a make up remover. I am very impressed with this product considering drunk elephant and clinic have a similar product for $40 dollars. This is a steal!

"The experience: Living in LA, skincare has to prioritize humidity, which has been <15% when I was trying out this facial cream.

"I have to say that I am not impressed at all by this Dermalogica Microfoliant, and I would not purchase the full size for a variety of reasons. 1.)   It is very messy.  You lose a lot of product just by pouring granules in your hands, and rubbing palms together, which means that you are literally putting money down the drain.  2.)  It’s so gentle that I frankly do not think there are any results as compared to other similar exfoliating products in this price range.  If you are going to spend this much, why not get a product that gives you visible results after a couple of uses instead of this? 3.) I do not think it is that revolutionary or earth friendly that this is in granule form instead of a liquid.  It benefits the company in the sense that they can ship more product for the same amount of money by weight, but the bottles take up the same amount of space in a truck or shipping container, and take the same amount of gas to haul around, and the consumer has to add water anyway, so I don’t see much value-added.

I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. The concept of this retinol stick is genius! I don’t have too many wrinkles around my eyes yet so I’m using this as a preventative measure. After using this for several weeks I do have to say that my eye area is a lot smoother and my concealer applies more nicely without any patches or flakiness. With retinol products it is not uncommon to experience some purging and I did get two small bumps/pimples (one on brow bone and other under my eye close to cheek area). Luckily these disappeared within a week and it was smooth sailing from there. The only reason why I’m not giving it 5 stars is because I wish it glided on more easily. There is slight tugging of the skin but it isn’t extreme,1.0,4,receive gift card select product choice review concept retinol stick genius dont many wrinkle around eye yet im use preventative measure use several week say eye area lot smooth concealer applies nicely without patch flakiness retinol product uncommon experience purge get two small bumpspimples one brow bone eye close cheek area luckily disappear within week smooth sail reason im give star wish glide easily slight tug skin isnt extreme

I hate to be the “Debbie downer“ here but I’m not sure what the hype is with this cream.  I’ve been using it for about a week now and don’t feel that it’s any different than a more affordable “high end“ moisturizer - adding the fact that it doesn’t even have an SPF.  It has a nice light scent and is rich and thick but this is a negative for me because it doesn’t smooth easily over my skin and even feels like it pulls a bit so I found myself tapping it on instead.  It didn’t melt into your skin (as I’ve experienced with other creams) and seems to instead sit on my skin until it absorbs after a few seconds.  I’m not overly impressed and don’t see what about this cream can justify the outrageous price.*I received this product complimentary from La Mer in exchange for my honest review,0.0,3,hate debbie downer im sure hype cream ive use week dont feel different affordable high end moisturizer add fact doesnt even spf nice light scent rich thick negative doesnt smooth easily skin even feel like pull bit find tap instead didnt melt skin ive experience cream seem instead sit skin absorbs second im overly impressed dont see cream justify outrageous pricei receive product complimentary la mer exchange honest review

"As a Greek girl Korres has been my go to skincare brand for years, so I was pretty happy to see they were carrying their own Sephora exclusive products stateside. After grabbing it on sale, I do have a few issues with it, especially in comparison to the other Korres products I own:1.) What’s up with the packaging? Not only is the bottle no longer slip proof, but it’s no longer 100% sustainable and guaranteed eco friendly2.) The formula...Usually Korres is pretty good about only including natural ingredients, but this thing apparently contains only 80% natural contents, and I can barely figure out what half of this is supposed to be. This is also a lot more drying than the almond face scrub I usually use (see photo on left.) and had a much stronger scent that their usual products.3.) THE PRICE. I paid about 7 euro for my Korres almond scrub face cleanser, so my jaw hit the floor when I saw that $13.00 was the clearance price. I get that it’s imported, but more than doubling the price before shipping feels absurd to me, especially when the packaging is already much cheaper than the real deal stuff.In short, I’m really disappointed, this isn’t the quality I’ve come to expect from the brand, and when I go to re stock it for sure won’t be through Sephora.",0.0,2,greek girl korres go skincare brand year pretty happy see carry sephora exclusive product stateside grab sale issue especially comparison korres product whats package bottle longer slip proof longer sustainable guaranteed eco friendly formulausually korres pretty good include natural ingredient thing apparently contain natural content barely figure half suppose also lot dry almond face scrub usually use see photo leave much strong scent usual product price pay euro korres almond scrub face cleanser jaw hit floor saw clearance price get import doubling price shipping feel absurd especially package already much cheap real deal stuffin short im really disappointed isnt quality ive come expect brand go stock sure wont sephora

There was a LOT of hype surrounding this product when this first came out so I was super excited to finally get my hands on when I picked it up in a my local Sephora a couple of weeks ago.

I mainly used this as an overnight mask/moisturizer by applying a light layer all over my face, and a heavier coating around my under-eye. Unfortunately, I noticed some pimples/bumps appearing around my chin and concluded it was coming from this mask. Maybe I was overdoing it? For context: I have PCOS and usually do not struggle with terrible chin acne! So if something breaks me out there and it’s not my hormones or diet acting up, I know it’s bad.

Previously, I’ve used the tatcha dewy skin cream during the day and the first aid beauty moisturizer at night. I’ve tried a couple different night creams, but none that have made enough difference, so I’ve typically used overnight moisturizing masks when I need deep hydration. I wasn’t confident this would fill a gap in my moisturizing routine, but it really has. It’s not advertised as an overnight moisturizer, but I find it to be good for that as well as in the day. It is super multi-purpose. It gives me the glow of the tatcha (though granted not quite as much) with the calming hydration of the first aid beauty. It is a thick, rich texture so you need very little of it to get the job done.

"I was looking for something to get rid of some red splotches that I had on my cheek and it seemed like this product might do the trick. I had high hopes for it since it was my first time trying a face care product with so many good reviews about it.First impression: My face did have a slight burning sensation the first time I tried it (I have sensitive skin) but I figured that was how I knew it was doing its job. It wasn’t a super uncomfortable feeling though and I left it on for its allotted time. After rinsing, I was so surprised at how soft my skin was! Some of my skin was left slightly dry, but overall, my face felt super soft and rejuvenated.2 months later: Following the incredible first usage of this product, everything sort of went downhill from there. I started breaking out more than usual (although I figured this was the product ’drawing out impurities’ from my skin, so I was only slightly alarmed), my skin became more dry after ever application, and I no longer get that tingly feeling to signify that the product was working. So now, my face has more breakouts than it has had in a long time, and it doesn’t seem like this product will help out.Overall impression: 2/5 -The price was too high for its results (should’ve bought the mini)-Leaves my skin rather dry with each usage-Ended up yielding more breakoutsObviously, everyone has different skin types and experiences but I wouldn’t recommend this product if you lean more towards the dry side of skin or if you have sensitive skin.",0.0,2,look something get rid red splotch cheek seem like product might trick high hope since first time try face care product many good review itfirst impression face slight burn sensation first time try sensitive skin figure knew job wasnt super uncomfortable feeling though leave allotted time rinse surprised soft skin skin leave slightly dry overall face felt super soft rejuvenate month later follow incredible first usage product everything sort go downhill start break usual although figured product draw impurity skin slightly alarmed skin become dry ever application longer get tingly feel signify product work face breakout long time doesnt seem like product help outoverall impression price high result shouldve bought minileaves skin rather dry usageended yield breakoutsobviously everyone different skin type experience wouldnt recommend product lean towards dry side skin sensitive skin

I have an engineering background and discovered the bottle has a design flaw. The pump in the chamber is not designed to release the entire serum. About a 1/3 of the product will never be able to be used unless you disassemble the bottle. The bottom third cannot go through the pump chamber due to insufficient action from the insert sleeve. Most consumers would assume they used all the product when the pump stops bringing it up through the chamber. But it can be easily proved when the bottle is disassembled and you can clearly see a substantial amount of serum still left in the insert sleeve. It’s unable to be used the way it’s designed. This needs to be addressed by the manufacturer because consumers are not getting what they are paying for,0.0,1,engineering background discover bottle design flaw pump chamber design release entire serum product never able used unless disassemble bottle bottom third go pump chamber due insufficient action insert sleeve consumer would assume use product pump stop bring chamber easily prove bottle disassemble clearly see substantial amount serum still leave insert sleeve unable used way design need address manufacturer consumer get pay

"I have been using the C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème for almost a month. The texture of the product is a hybrid between a gel and a cream. It is lightweight and not sticky. It smells almost like a creamcicle, but it’s not overpowering. I have oily to combo, sensitive skin. The first time I used this moisturizer I applied it right after washing my face without my usual routine (toner, oils, etc.) The next morning my face was a bit dry. Once I incorporated the moisturizer into my normal routine, I loved the results. I have used this moisturizer day and night. It leaves my skin with a beautiful glow, but definitely not greasy or oily. I don’t need much product. The only negative is that I do not like the packaging. I don’t like to stick my fingers in the product. I’d much rather use a bottle with a pump.

"On a whole, this product line was nothing impressive. Each item on it’s own lacked anything that I would call a skin improvement. And used together, I felt little benefits. It’s truly hard to rate each individual item, which is why I have grouped them all under one review.The Cleanser: the cleanser was soft and gentle, and had a nice foam to it. It strongly reminded me of the drug store cleansers I used as a teenager (Clearasil). Unfortunately, it does not do a good job cleansing. With makeup, I had to do several washes and still couldn’t remove all makeup. Without makeup, there was still a lot of dirt on the cotton pad used after toner. Clear Lotion: this is just their fancy way of saying toner. Again, nothing impressive about this toner. It did it’s basic function without leaving my face dry or sticky. Pitera Essence: this is their signature product line ingredient. The Pitera essence is meant to be patted onto your cleansed and toned skin. Not entirely sure I’m seeing the results they claim. I felt they placed a lot of emphasis on how amazing Pitera is, almost like an infomercial. Airy Milk Lotion: nothing airy or milk like about this moisturizer. It is on the thicker side, with an extremely high fragrance. Any slight cuts or open acne will burn upon application. My face was left feeling slightly sticky. Even with primer, makeup application looked streaky at best. The moisturizer truly felt like a cheap product. Overall, the product line is cheap feeling and offered very little, if any overall benefits. This Proctor and Gamble skin line is a cheap product disguised as a high end product line. Don’t be fooled. The product strongly reminds me of Proactiv, though I’d recommend the Proactiv line far over this line.

I have been using this product for about a week now and I think it is an amazing pre cleanse oil. It is extremely easy to use it it really does take way all the make up off of my fees and doesn’t sting my eyes of it gets too close to my eyes. I’ve noticed afterwards my face already feels a lot later before I then go and wash my face perion I really can’t wait to use this in the summertime when I’m putting on more sunblock because I am out in the Sun more frequently they in in the Winter time period. I think that the best part is how easily it takes off I make up such as miss Kara and I shadow. It really takes it off I do put on a wipe off and put a little bit more on in order to get all of the mascara but it really doesn’t leave a residue behind. A great feature is that it’s cruelty free and that there’s no fragrance in it’s very good for my sensitive skin I have not had one break out yet which usually from new products a break out with acne after the 1st fuest in with this product I haven’t done that period I really have seen smoother skin my skin feels cleaner as well,1.0,5,use product week think amaze pre cleanse oil extremely easy use really take way make fee doesnt sting eye get close eye ive noticed afterwards face already feel lot later go wash face perion really cant wait use summertime im put sunblock sun frequently winter time period think best part easily take make miss kara shadow really take put wipe put little bit order get mascara really doesnt leave residue behind great feature cruelty free there fragrance good sensitive skin one break yet usually new product break acne st fuest product havent do period really see smoother skin skin feel cleaner well
I really wanted to like this cream with the great ingredients and antioxidant claims! But I found it made my skin very dry... I did not change any products in my routine and once starting the night cream I had texture and extremely dry patches around my mouth and forehead. It does have a scent but it’s not too overpowering.

I got a sample of from Sephora and it’s just alright. I do feel like it exfoliates the skin and it’s definitely not as strong as other acid toners I’ve used in the past like the Tarte Knockout and the GlamGlow Supertoner. I think it’s in the nice middle spot where it’s not too gentle but you still feel like it does something. The reason why I don’t really like it and I won’t be purchasing a full size version of this is because it feels soapy on the skin. When I put it on a cotton pad it kind of feels like a surfactant which is very strange to me and I don’t like that feeling. Your probably thinking maybe you have residual cleanser on your face but i only use this toner once a day and I always cleanse my face in the shower to make sure that I throughly wash my cleanser of my face so I don’t really know why I get that soapy texture on my skin I just know I don’t like it and this is a pass for me.,0.0,3,get sample sephora alright feel like exfoliates skin definitely strong acid toner ive use past like tarte knockout glamglow supertoner think nice middle spot gentle still feel like something reason dont really like wont purchase full size version feel soapy skin put cotton pad kind feel like surfactant strange dont like feel probably think maybe residual cleanser face use toner day always cleanse face shower make sure throughly wash cleanser face dont really know get soapy texture skin know dont like pas

Best toner ever! I tried a lot and never really saw a difference besides this and the Rose Fresh one. I live in really harsh winter in my state and I get so dry but super oily during the day. The best part about this is if I get a pimple; I use the cotton pad to apply the product all over my face then place the pad on that pimple or problem area like a mini mask for about a min. Makes a huge difference. Literally shrink them and calm them right away. Then I pat on the Rose Toner from Fresh for extra moisturization before my moisturizer. I know it’s kinda crazy but I find that this double toning method really helped my skin. I would wear sunscreen using this though since it has acid in it.

"Herbivore Botanicals recently gifted me the Blue Tansy face mask.First off let’s talk texture. This mask has a bluish green color  that is gel like and in-between thick and liquidy. The blue tansy incorporated in this mask is the main ingredient. Its high in azulene which is what gives it the color and scent.  I was a little surprised that it was more green than blue, but because of the natural ingredients it can be either color. Now the scent is a whole other story. I’m not going to lie , I am not a fan. I love a good natural and herbal scent, but this one is too strong for me. I’m still able to wear the mask for the full 20 minutes , but with the off putting aroma I don’t find it very pleasurable like some other masks. Still even with me not caring for the scent of it , I love the results I got from it.  All I can say is WOW!! I had a breakout in a couple areas on my face and this literally got rid of my acne. I was stunned at how well it worked. It reduced the redness and size of my pimples dramatically where they were pretty much non existent. I’ve never used a mask that worked so well for my acne.

I am honestly so pleasantly surprised after only using this product for a week! My skin really looks brighter, plumper, and more radiant.  My fine lines and wrinkles really appear smaller and more plump.  My skin is more smooth, and hydrated than normal. This lactic acid treatment is great for exfoliating, and fighting the build up of dead skin cells. It includes ingredients such as licorice for brightening, lemongrass for toning, arnica to soothe, and aloe to soothe and moisturize skin. It’s so simple to use, just apply 1-2 pumps on dry skin, and follow with moisturizer, or use as a mask for sensitive skin. I used this in conjunction with my Sunday Riley Luna Sleeping Oil, and the results were amazing. I woke up with amazingly youthful looking skin. I can’t wait to see how my skin looks after two weeks. I would highly recommend, even though it is a pricy option, it’s worth it 100%!!",1.0,5,gift sunday riley good gene allinone lactic acid treatment exchange review personal mission year find skincare product really target problem area include brighten hydrate revitalize improve appearance fine line wrinkle honestly pleasantly surprised use product week skin really look brighter plumper radiant fine line wrinkle really appear small plump skin smooth hydrate normal lactic acid treatment great exfoliate fight build dead skin cell include ingredient licorice brighten lemongrass tone arnica soothe aloe soothe moisturize skin simple use apply pump dry skin follow moisturizer use mask sensitive skin use conjunction sunday riley luna sleep oil result amaze wake amazingly youthful look skin cant wait see skin look two week would highly recommend even though pricy option worth

I don’t love the formula - it feels quite greasy to me and made me break out on my more oily areas (chin, forehead). It might be user error - maybe I’m using too much?

Big fan of Tatcha products so I was ecstatic to get to test it out for free. I live in the midwest USA and the winter is not always kind to my dry skin. Tatcha to the rescue! The serum has a balm like consistency and feels very smooth and soft on your skin. This makes it easy for makeup to glide on but might need a little longer to set. My favorite use of this serum is to lay on thick at night and just let sit sink in to the skin. With the balmy consistency this serum stays put where you apply it and the stick makes it easy to concentrate on areas that need a little more love. The fact that it’s january and my skin is not all dry and parched has me over the moon. And so does the fact that this product barely has any scent!,1.0,5,big fan tatcha product ecstatic get test free live midwest usa winter always kind dry skin tatcha rescue serum balm like consistency feel smooth soft skin make easy makeup glide might need little long set favorite use serum lay thick night let sit sink skin balmy consistency serum stay put apply stick make easy concentrate area need little love fact january skin dry parch moon fact product barely scent

"I think almost every review starts with “I was skeptical of this cream, but...“ and mine is no exception. I *was* skeptical and wanted to hate it (still do kinda), but I just don’t. Yes, I think the price is crazy (and don’t think I didn’t notice the price jumped from $215 to $230, Sephora), but this has made such a big difference in my skin since I started using it a couple months ago. Doesn’t make the price tag easier to swallow, but I’ve totally drunk the Kool-Aid.I mostly use it at night because it’s very thick and I have combo to oily skin (although I don’t like the Soft Cream), and frankly I want it to last as long as humanly possible. If I don’t use it one night, I immediately notice the difference in my glow, smoothness, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles the next morning. That sealed the deal for me. Tried the Nivea dupe and it just doesn’t compare. Fortunately a little goes a long way, and you MUST warm it up beforehand or it doesn’t spread/absorb properly. I cleanse with micellar water or the Peter Thomas Roth anti-aging cleanser, then follow with Etude House toner and Drunk Elephant Framboos serum, then La Mer, and my skin looks incredible the next day, just lit from within, smooth, and with significant reduction in fine lines. I’m 32 and I’ve constantly been getting compliments on how I look 10 years younger with my current routine. During the day I use the DE C-Firma and B-Hydra and the Murad Essential-C Day Moisture with SPF. This combination has my skin looking the best it ever have. (See filter-free photo below.)I can’t justify the expense of the rest of the line, but if you use this consistently and in combination with other quality skincare products that work (for you), your skin will look great.

"At first I was really skeptical about using this product because of all the mixed reviews. I have pretty sensitive skin that I would say I have “under control” at this point. I wanted to add something to my skin care routine that would help reduce redness. I first went for a makeup product but the Sephora associate talked me into this. I have been using the product for 2 weeks now and I LOVE IT. It is the perfect balance between skincare and makeup.

"I received the Summer Fridays jet lag mask complimentary from Summer Fridays. This product was reformulated recently after a recall. I’ve never used the original but the reformulated version is REALLY nice! This product is supposed to nourish, hydrate and calm skin. It can be used as an overnight mask or a moisturizer. Key ingredients : ⭐️ Niacinamide- reduces inflammation and redness, protects skin from damage caused by sun, minimizes fine lines and wrinkles, lightens dark spots⭐️ Hyaluronic Acid- hydrates skin making it plump, smooth and healthy looking⭐️ Glycerin- leaves skin soft and supple❤️ How I incorporated into my routine:I only used a small dab and smoothed a thin layer on my face after cleansing and drying. I kept it on overnight in place of a moisturizer and did not use anything else, not even essence water. ❤️ what I loved about the product:I thought it would be thick and pasty but it was surprisingly easy to spread thinly. It absorbed really quickly. Once absorbed, my skin felt satiny smooth! All throughout the night, I kept touching my face because it felt so smooth. There was no oily or greasy feeling. It wasn’t heavy either. In fact, I didn’t feel anything there yet my face felt moisturized. The next morning when I woke up, my face still felt very smooth. It was as if someone buffered it.  My red spots and dark spots were still visible to the eye but not to the touch. I am hoping that with use of this product over time that will change too.

These have noticeable results on deep cystic acne spots - leaving a puffy whit spot where the gunk is soaked up (see picture). It seems to nicely trap it inside so there’s no mess. I haven’t found any better options on this type of pimple. Unlike topicals that dry out the top layer leaving the skin irritated & flake these seems to penetrate down to address the under layers. I haven’t noticed these being as effective on more surface pimples - at least it’s not as clear. I love the no mess aspect of them & that there’s nothing to rub off and stain pretty pillow cases.

"Let me start by saying I am constantly raving about DE’s glycolic acid and babyfacial. I always have backups because they’ve changed my skin like nothing has ever before. Now during the summer I use self tanner all over my body but not my face because I have sensitive, oily skin. It’s not a problem when I wear makeup and match my color, but I don’t like to wear makeup everyday so this seemed perfect for those days (and to wear underneath my makeup). I used it for about 3 weeks and now I’ve gotten a pretty good feel for it. I mixed one pump with my moisturizer every morning and worked it into my skin with my fingers. It doesn’t make me more oily, but it does have a sheen that makes my face appear even shinier than it already is. Not a big deal, I just blot when I need to. The first thing I’ve noticed, however, is that the color is a bit on the orange side. It’s not super orange, but it’s much warmer than my self tan and it does not match well. The second thing I’ve noticed, which is SUCH a bummer, is that this clogs my pores. I’ve had a huge increase in blackheads on my nose and closed comedones on my forehead. I kept having to extract them and they would come back within a day or two. I stopped using it for a few days to make sure that this was the culprit (even though I didn’t change anything else in my routine), and low and behold this is what’s been making me break out.

"To start off I have oily, acne-prone skin, that got irritated, flaky, dehydrated due to Adapalene and other acne-fighting products/ingredients. Most moisturizers break me out BUT NOT THIS ONE.

"First off, I’m used to using the “supergoop” brand of sunscreen so I compared the Shiseido to the supergoop. It says that it’s supposed to be ocean friendly and that’s what I look for in sunscreens. I also like to make sure that it’s not oily and greasy along with leaving my skin looking cracked when it dries. For this to be almost a $40 sunscreen it shouldn’t leave my skin looking cracked but it did. The texture is like any other regular sunscreen and it’s a white thickish liquid that goes on smooth but does leave a little greasy bit of residue on your hands. It does have a soft pleasant smell though and it is actually water resistant for almost 2 hours. Another pro is that it does have hyaluronic acid in it which is great for keeping skin moisturized.

I have used this for 2 days and sadly I don’t love this as much as I had wanted to/expected to!I will say that I did love the texture, it’s so silky and easy to apply- a little goes a long way! Plus there is no fragrance that I could tell, which is a plus for me! I also love the type of packaging it comes in! It’s easy to use and no chances of spilling! It sunk into my skin right away which was lovely, but then I felt my skin needing more moisture. It was almost like a first step before applying something thicker or more occlusive (for my particular skin type). If you don’t have super dry skin, I could see this being a wonderful face  cream for you! If it weren’t for the outrageously high price tag, I would just finish the jar, but I cannot justify the price based on the performance on my skin. I know I can definitely find something more effective for a lower price, so I will be returning :(",1.0,3,dry skin mix retinol use cold canadian climate thought would try sephora sale use day sadly dont love much want toexpected toi say love texture silky easy apply little go long way plus fragrance could tell plus also love type packaging come easy use chance spill sunk skin right away lovely felt skin needing moisture almost like first step apply something thicker occlusive particular skin type dont super dry skin could see wonderful face cream werent outrageously high price tag would finish jar justify price base performance skin know definitely find something effective low price return

"Now that I’m in my thirties and have fine lines around my eyes, I’ve been searching for the perfect eye cream that will help with wrinkles.  My 90-year-old grandma with the smoothest skin hypes up Shiseido skincare products, so I was interested in testing this Benefiance eye cream from the brand.  Unfortunately, this is not the product for me and my search will go one.  The product claims you may see results as early as 2 weeks, but I see no difference after using the eye cream twice a day as directed for 3 weeks.  I see no improvement in my fine lines around my eyes and my dark undereye circles look just as bad.For the price of $70, I expect much more in terms of the efficacy and ingredient quality in this eye cream.  When reading the ingredient list, the top 5 ingredients are the same you will find in cheap skincare products and the active ingredients meant to fight wrinkles are very far down on the ingredient list, which means they are in teeny tiny amounts in this eye cream.On the positive side, it hasn’t caused any irritation to my delicate skin around my eyes or stung my eyes. I do agree this product is very hydrating, but it comes across as very thick and sits on top of my skin and takes hours to absorb into my skin.  Therefore, I plan to only use this eye cream at night in the future, because it’s very hard to apply any concealer or makeup on top of this cream.Even though I’ll continue to use it as a super hydrating night cream for my eye area, I would not buy it myself or recommend it to anyone else since it’s very expensive for a product that did not deliver any wrinkle smoothing results.",0.0,2,im thirty fine line around eye ive search perfect eye cream help wrinkle yearold grandma smooth skin hype shiseido skincare product interested test benefiance eye cream brand unfortunately product search go one product claim may see result early week see difference use eye cream twice day direct week see improvement fine line around eye dark undereye circle look badfor price expect much term efficacy ingredient quality eye cream read ingredient list top ingredient find cheap skincare product active ingredient meant fight wrinkle far ingredient list mean teeny tiny amount eye creamon positive side hasnt cause irritation delicate skin around eye stung eye agree product hydrating come across thick sits top skin take hour absorb skin therefore plan use eye cream night future hard apply concealer makeup top creameven though ill continue use super hydrating night cream eye area would buy recommend anyone else since expensive product deliver wrinkle smooth result
"This moisturizer is very disappointing! I am a huge fan of Fresh as a brand but this moisturizer is NOT IT. Not sure how it has all the great reviews it does.

I have other moisturizers that cost a fraction of the price that provide the same amount of hydration this does. It also has a a bit of a tacky feel to it when you touch your face, and pills LIKE CRAZY. Definitely do not use this under foundation unless you want to be a clumpy mess.

"I was gifted by Dermalogica a few samples packs of their Daily microfoliant. The Daily Microfoliant is a gentle exfoliant that comes in a powder form and is meant to be combined with water.

I have mixed feelings about this cream. It is a great moisturizer but I don’t like its smell and texture. The cream is pretty thick and not soft enough to be easy to spread and massage into the face. It’s a lot of work for it to get absorbed. It had this weird gritty feel to it even though it’s smooth and you can’t see any particles or anything like that. It also smells like an old medicine cabinet.

This was an item given to me by influenster for my honest opinion. I really like the packaging and thought it had a nice no not too overpowering.

I only used it three times because it made me break out so bad.

"Best makeup remover I ever tried.  Yes, it’s expensive, but a little bit goes a long way.  I use a spatula to get the balm out as I don’t want to put my fingers into the jar (yuck on bacteria) and get the stuff under my nails.  I spray a little rubbing alcohol on the spatula then rinse it off and dry it on a clean towel.  It’s not a cleanser by itself.  I still use a cleanser after that.  It feels a little like vaseline but not a thick.  I massage it all over my face and neck and make sure to get it near my hairline and close to my ears.  After massaging it in, I take lukewarm water and mix it in and the balm becomes like a lotion.  I use a cotton pad to swipe the makeup off.

Claims to be a face wash and an exfoliator. Does a poor job at both. There are better products out there that cleanse and exfoliate your face more for much less. I would only recommend this if you want something really gentle. My face does not feel clean after I use this that I have to use a foam cleanser before and then use this after for added exfoliation. The sugar grains are also very small and they dissolve before they can even properly exfoliate you. I think you’re much better off using a chemical exfoliant like AHAs or BHAs instead of physical exfoliants like this. If you want a good sugar scrub kinda product I would recommend the moment of truth 3 in 1 sugar scrub from ole henriksen.,0.0,2,claim face wash exfoliator poor job well product cleanse exfoliate face much less would recommend want something really gentle face feel clean use use foam cleanser use add exfoliation sugar grain also small dissolve even properly exfoliate think youre much well use chemical exfoliant like ahas bhas instead physical exfoliants like want good sugar scrub kinda product would recommend moment truth sugar scrub ole henriksen
I used to be a faithful Clinique user.  It was all I ever used.  As I have gotten older I have broadened my horizons and forgot how moisturizing their products were.

"I shopped around for a GOOD makeup remover. Specifically something that could remove everything from my eye area. It needed to remove all of the eye makeup and be gentle so I didn’t end up ruining my lash line. This product was highly recommended on several beauty blogs so I decided to give it a try. It’s AMAZING for what I wanted. Leaves skin feeling buttery soft, no residue, product packaging is well thought out with magnetic scoop, lasts for 3-4 months depending how much you use. Definitely part of my everyday routine. Make sure to use a generous amount. Keep away from heated area (I don’t store in my shower because it tends to separate the product). I have acne prone skin and can still use it throughout my entire face to remove makeup. I do use a different cleanser afterwards and the combination works great to not cause breakouts either.

"I did not expect much! I was pleasantly surprised to see results after just 2 weeks. The texture is very nice and non greasy feeling. This really does attack multiple issues. In a couple of weeks- brightness, even tone, smaller pores, reduction in lines with an overall look of vibrancy. Apply after moisturizer and enjoy... it contains salicylic acid which is great!!! This combats inflammation, unclogs pores and helps clear away dead skin. I saw someone say “I don’t want salicylic acid in my serum“ it’s important to understand how important this ingredient is and that it is not just for acne solutions at all. Salicylic comes from the white willow bark in nature but can now be made in the lab. Aspirin was originally from the white willow bark, therefore it’s a wonder ingredient & less aggravating than other acids 4 face. Think about it, aspirin is anti inflammatory and salicylic literally unglues gunk on the surface of skin and in the pores while calm redness. Anyway, this is packed with great ingredients and wears well under makeup. My skin is finicky so I had to cut back to once per day application as it’s amazing ingredients caused a bit of irritation but it did clear up my skin and refine it. it Does add a touch of moisture too. Impressed that it cleared my face & lit it up. I cleanse, exfoliate with Tatcha enzyme rice and then their Essence, then Clinique moisture surge super concentrate gel, smart repair night moisturizer as needed and then the Smart Serum. It’s one of the best out there that is a full on multiplayer for yor skin! Warning: resist over application. Less is more and a 1oz will last longer than a month especially if just using on face. Bottom line- it is packed with great stuff 4 skin.

"To start with, the packaging was very thoughtful. They put it in a brown box that’s giving the “clean“ vibe. They also provided 2 caps (handy when traveling)! Not to mention the fact that the color and smell is amazing. It does make my face feel tighter, refreshing, and clean- however, I have a dry skin, and this make my skin feel tighter in a dry way afterward (you can see the flakiness below my nose). I would say it’s a bit overprice for its quality. I don’t feel that much different. Another thing is that it doesn’t effectively remove my makeup. Especially, eyeliner. I can see why though. This is a gentle and clean cleanser, so nothing surprising. I found that by using cotton pads to wipe of the foam help removing my makeup (a great way to see if there’s any makeup left or not). If you wear light makeup, you’ll be fine. For anyone wearing waterproof or somewhat lots of makeup, consider purchasing a makeup remover. Overall, it’s a great product! It did what it supposed to do. So that’s why I’m rating it 4 stars. Oh- did I forgot to mention the fact that it’s clean and vegan (+ no fragrance)?

This just wasnt as moisturizing as the tatcha. It did sink in right away, although, I felt a little too fast. It left me with a matte feeling on my face. I had to top it off with a facial oil just so I could get rid of that matte feeling. Its not a horrible product.  I just think my face needed more moisture than this could provide.

"When I originally ordered this product, I had no idea what it did exactly, but I was looking to try something new & I’m so thankful I did! This product is amazing! If I’m being honest, I’m still not fully educated on the complete spectrum of what it does, but I DO know when I don’t use it, I can tell a clear difference in the moisture content, plump & brightness of my skin. I use it as a cocktail with a light Vita C serum. The consistency’s are comparable & absorb beautifully into my skin together. It creates this perfect foundation for my following serums & moisturizer. Packaging. It appears that it is somewhat difficult for a lot of people to maneuver. I have not had this experience. Knowing ahead of time that the dropper is fragile & glass, I always am mindful & extremely gentle. They recommend to remove dropper, push button to release the air, and insert back in to product to suction the dose. This way you can avoid adding any additional air into the bottle. I generally do this after each use, so it is all ready for the next time I need it. In reality, you should be using this method with all your beauty products with droppers, as adding air into products will further its oxidation & expire quicker. So they are actually attempting to educate you on proper dropper etiquette.Your skin regenerates approx. every 27days, Having had used this over a full skin cycle, I can comfortably recommend it to others.

"UserFull disclosure I received this product as a sample to try in exchange for an honest review. First, I’ll say I like the packaging, it’s classy and does not use a ton of extraneous plastic. I was instructed to apply it 2x a day after cleansing, so I did. I’ve been using this product for a month since Jan 25th 2021. I have some fine lines on the corners of my eyes, smile lines, and also have dark circles. In this past month, I have noticed that my skin around my eyes feels more hydrated and plump. As a result, I think I did see a slight reduction in my fine lines. The secret to getting rid of fine lines is actually hydration, so I am not surprised. It did not do anything for my under eye circles, and I am not surprised because I don’t think any product is capable of lessening my dark circles. I did notice that I had 3 different clogged pores around the outer corners of my eyes/eyebrow region after starting to use this product. I think it’s because of how creamy and thick this product is. I did not notice any sensitivities or adverse reactions otherwise. I am typically more sensitive to fragrances. Something that stood out to me was the smell. It had a chemical smell when I first opened it and figured it out when I read the list of ingredients. It was the Isopropyl Isostearate, which is made from isopropyl alcohol and stearic acid. It didn’t affect my skin at all, just something I picked up on. Honestly, I don’t think I would buy this at full price. It’s so expensive and I am a broke student who can’t afford to splurge on $70 eye creams!",0.0,3,userfull disclosure receive product sample try exchange honest review first ill say like package classy use ton extraneous plastic instruct apply x day cleanse ive use product month since jan th fine line corner eye smile line also dark circle past month notice skin around eye feel hydrate plump result think see slight reduction fine line secret get rid fine line actually hydration surprised anything eye circle surprise dont think product capable lessen dark circle notice different clog pore around out corner eyeseyebrow region start use product think creamy thick product notice sensitivity adverse reaction otherwise typically sensitive fragrance something stand smell chemical smell first open figure read list ingredient isopropyl isostearate make isopropyl alcohol stearic acid didnt affect skin something pick honestly dont think would buy full price expensive break student cant afford splurge eye cream

"I got a sample of this cleanser, and I was more than happy to try it because I generally like Korres products and have heard good things about this. For reference, I have normal skin with minor aging concerns that leans toward dry, especially in the colder months.This is the type of cleanser I love. Creamy, adequate foam, and it does a great job of taking off a full face of makeup (including mascara and eyeliner). This is the type of cleanser I love to use in the winter months especially, because it has a very creamy texture that actually leaves my face feeling replenished after washing it. One of my favorite cleansers is the Belif Creamy Cleansing Foam Moist, and this reminds me a lot of that. I am not sensitive to fragrances, but this has a really light, slightly sweet scent that seems pretty neutral to me. A little bit seems to go a long way, so this seems like a reasonable economic choice when compared to similar cleansers from comparable brands on the market.

But he couldn’t go off them coz he was in his final two weeks of nicotine patches and this was a new brand that was giving him a severe reaction. So after the second night I put this on his red round patches and the next morning they were gone. The moment I put it on his skin just drank it all up. It was unbelievable. Now with the covid19 and both of us always excessively hand washing and sanitizing, our skin has been cracking and dry and super itchy. So this is our go to cream first thing in the morning and last thing at night. I wish it wasn’t this pricey but hey....... it gets the job done. I genuinely don’t know how people use this on their face unless their skin type is super dry or have eczema and such. This is an extremely healing but also extremely moisturizing cream.

"Am I using this product wrong, or does it just not work on my face!? I received a deluxe sample of the balm and was really excited to try it out, given the claims that it can remove eye makeup. I’ve since used it 3 times, and it doesn’t do a thing to remove my face or my eye makeup. I even tried first using the Sephora eye makeup remover to take off the first layer of eye makeup the second time I tried the balm, and all of the residual makeup left after using the liquid eye makeup remover was still there - no difference from if I’d never used the balm in the first place. The other night I tried using the balm again, this time just to remove my face makeup, and when I applied toner to my face after washing, the cotton ball containing the toner was covered in makeup, making it obvious that the cleansing balm did nothing! I don’t think I wear very heavy makeup and my mascara isn’t waterproof, so either the claims about the cleansing balm are greatly exaggerated or it just doesn’t work on my face. I’ll be using my makeup removers and regular facial cleansers instead.",0.0,1,use product wrong work face receive deluxe sample balm really excited try give claim remove eye makeup ive since use time doesnt thing remove face eye makeup even try first use sephora eye makeup remover take first layer eye makeup second time try balm residual makeup leave use liquid eye makeup remover still difference id never use balm first place night try use balm time remove face makeup apply toner face wash cotton ball contain toner cover makeup make obvious cleanse balm nothing dont think wear heavy makeup mascara isnt waterproof either claim cleanse balm greatly exaggerate doesnt work face ill use makeup remover regular facial cleanser instead

"After such rave and my support for Marianna, I decided to purchase. Let me tell you, do NOT purchase if you are looking for a mask/moisturizer. It felt almost like applying Ponds cold creme but a bit drier. The product felt more like a marketing tactic and yes, the packaging is not a great idea at all -- I had to think of ways to place the mask so it will not leak out by itself. There will be mornings/nights when I am opening the product and it will come out like toothpaste -- dime/nickel size length.. keep in mind.. you cannot place it back inside. As you are trying to save that, by the time you finish -- another toothpaste comes out. Throughout the day, I did not feel that it was moisturizing, instead, there were built-up of oil on my nose area. Blot throughout the day! Other than that, I was thinking if I should return the product after 2 uses with disappointment but I felt that this product was a mess and it wouldn’t be a nice gesture at all to return.

"It was too heavy for my skin. Every morning I woke up with a greasy face dripping in oil after using it the night before. When I was buying the product from the Sephora store, I asked the lady who was helping me if this product was suitable for oily and acne prone skin and she told me that it’s good for acne as well. Also in the packaging it says that it’s suitable for all skin type but in reality it’s too heavy for oily skin. My pores looked huge because it was clogged. I really wanted to like this product because of all the good reviews I read. I didn’t even use moisturizer because I know that my skin can’t handle so much layers. Even when I was using just this one single product my skin was still super oily in the next morning. I have returned this product. Now my pores are returning to their original size and my face is producing less oil. I think this is a good product for super dry or mature skin.

"The only pro to this mist is that if you want to tighten your pores after washing your face, it’ll do the trick, but I don’t think the smell and the eye burn is worth it. The almost menthol-y smell is way too overpowering, and it follows you after your spray. I hold my breath and spray my whole face and neck and then try to walk away from the bathroom before inhaling, but the mist lingers in the air around your face like a cloud so you can’t escape breathing in the chokingly overpowering smell of the product. After a bit of coughing, the next problem I notice is that my eyes burn when I open them. I have to be very careful when I spray to avoid my eyes either by holding my hand over them or wearing a sleeping eye mask which is just a nuisance to have to worry about when applying a toner.

"I received the Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme sample free from Influenster andEstee Lauderin exchange for my honest review.Most skincare requires a few weeks to a few months to see actual results, so with this tiny sample I can only give my first impressions of application and ingredients. The cream spreads easily and smoothly with a bit of slip that most silicone makeup primers have. It leaves skin feeling moisturized and sealed. It smells very fragranced, and I worry about the jar packaging for light, air, and bacteria exposure. Any beneficial ingredients will likely break down over time. As for ingredients, the list is very long! We have no idea whether any past the top few have enough included to make any difference in skin. The top ingredients are water, silicones, and penetration enhancers, hence the silky smooth texture. After that is a bunch of potentially beneficial peptides, plant extracts, and other actives, but also plenty of fragrant plant extracts and actual fragrance. If you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you, as even natural fragrances damage skin barriers. It’s nice to see that the moringa and hibiscus flower extracts that are prominently advertised are further up on the ingredients list. Personally, I’m not sure I trust the less studied plant extracts for anti-aging as much as some of the highly studied workhorse ingredients that are further down the list, like hyaluronic acid, vitamin e, squalane, and caffeine. I think this has a potential to be a great moisturizer, but is overly fragranced for me, relies too much on silicones to give a temporarily smooth feel to skin, and unfortunately comes in a jar that won’t keep the long list of potentially helpful plant extracts from degrading..#nofilter #gotitfree #complimentary  #free #influenstervoxbox #complimentary @Influenster  #contest @esteelauder #skin #skincare #esteelauder #esteelauderxinfluenster",0.0,1,receive revitalize supreme youth power creme sample free influenster andestee lauderin exchange honest reviewmost skincare require week month see actual result tiny sample give first impression application ingredient cream spread easily smoothly bite slip silicone makeup primer leave skin feel moisturize sealed smell fragranced worry jar packaging light air bacteria exposure beneficial ingredient likely break time ingredient list long idea whether past top enough include make difference skin top ingredient water silicone penetration enhancer hence silky smooth texture bunch potentially beneficial peptide plant extract active also plenty fragrant plant extract actual fragrance sensitive skin may even natural fragrance damage skin barrier nice see moringa hibiscus flower extract prominently advertised ingredient list personally im sure trust less studied plant extract antiaging much highly studied workhorse ingredient list like hyaluronic acid vitamin e squalane caffeine think potential great moisturizer overly fragranced relies much silicone give temporarily smooth feel skin unfortunately come jar wont keep long list potentially helpful plant extract degradingnofilter gotitfree complimentary free influenstervoxbox complimentary influenster contest esteelauder skin skincare esteelauder esteelauderxinfluenster

This does not absorb into my skin very well. It just leaves a greasy film over the area of application. Perhaps someone who has very dry skin might enjoy this product.

"After 8  years of trying to help my acne prone skin drunk elephant products have rescued me. I tried antibiotics, different birth controls, and Accutane. I started first by using A-Passioni Retinol Cream (beginning of January) after reading up on the benefits of using a retinol. I bought this from Sephora in the limited edition “Midi Committee Drunk Drawer“ (mini sizes of : A-Passioni Retinol Cream   Protini Polypeptide Cream   B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum   Slaai Makeup Melting Butter Cleanser   Bamboo Booster). I used A-Passioni 2x a week with Protini (use this everyday as a moisturizer morning and night). I eventually built up the tolerance to using it every night. After one month and positive results I decided to invest in more Drunk Elephant products. I ordered the T.L.C Sukari Babyfacial from the Drunk Elephant website (free coupon for new website customers!) which came with a free “Oh What A Night Smoothie” (sample sizes of : T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Night Serum   Lala Retro Whipped Cream   B-Hydra). I use Babyfacial 1x a week followed by the Virgin Marula Antioxidant Face Oil (Babyfacial came with a sample size). On the night I use Babyfacial, I don’t use any other product besides the Marula Oil. I started integrating Framboos into my routine by alternating nights with either Framboos (AHA/BHA) or A-Passioni (Retinol). Then I started using Framboos during my morning routine and A-Passioni at night since (you don’t want to use them at the same time). I mix the Framboos with a squirt of B-Hydra, and then follow with Protini. All of these products are absolutely worth it, and the minis last for months.

It’s not drying and my skin looks and feels so soft after using it!

"First off I would like to say how the bottle embodied the brand perfectly, the hexagon shape bottle that resembles the bees honeycomb! So beautiful!! I’m not going to lie I was nervous to try this seeing how I’m prone to acne and have large pores, I couldn’t be more delighted that I got to try this out! Upon applying the oil is super light weight and feels like water, there is no greasy or slip to it like a regular oil. There is little tiny golden dots in the bottle which is Commiphora Oil and these melt on contact with skin and create a beautiful sensorial texture. The oil not only feels opulent but it really does the job! After I finished washing my face I applied this oil right away, it absorbed immediately leaving my skin supple with a lovely soft focus glow, my skin felt firmed and definitely nourished. After a month of soild using this in my skin regime, I can say my skin looks more hydrated and healthy, has a beautiful glow and definitely more firm, my skin texture is more smoothed out which has made smile lines look less pronounced and softer. I didn’t think it really pumped up my skin but I could see it doing that on more mature skin. I think this oil is absolutely amazing and great for anyone who needs some extra hydration and extra radiance. I have applied the watery youth oil directly on my skin and mixed into my moisturizer, foundation, or tinted sunscreen... I can say my favorite is to apply the oil raw to washed skin but I 100% love love love applying it into my foundation!! It just makes the foundation application go on smoother and makes you have that super healthy skin look! The only con I will say is this oil is heavily scented! It is natural scent but to some people I know this might be a deal breaker. Aside that I think everyone should incorporate this into their regime, you will be pleasantly surprized if you don’t have sensitive skin to fragrance.",1.0,5,first would like say bottle embodied brand perfectly hexagon shape bottle resemble bee honeycomb beautiful im go lie nervous try see im prone acne large pore couldnt delighted get try upon apply oil super light weight feel like water greasy slip like regular oil little tiny golden dot bottle commiphora oil melt contact skin create beautiful sensorial texture oil feel opulent really job finish wash face apply oil right away absorb immediately leave skin supple lovely soft focus glow skin felt firmed definitely nourished month soild use skin regime say skin look hydrate healthy beautiful glow definitely firm skin texture smooth make smile line look less pronounced soft didnt think really pump skin could see mature skin think oil absolutely amazing great anyone need extra hydration extra radiance apply watery youth oil directly skin mixed moisturizer foundation tint sunscreen say favorite apply oil raw wash skin love love love apply foundation make foundation application go smoother make super healthy skin look con say oil heavily scent natural scent people know might deal breaker aside think everyone incorporate regime pleasantly surprized dont sensitive skin fragrance

"I’m a pretty avid skincare user and I’ve tried quite a few different overnight sleeping masks from Laneige to Belif. With that said, I tested this product for 2 weeks before giving a review.PROS:- Lightweight cooling gel essence feels good on skin- Heavier cream seals in product overnight and protect’s skins barrier- Absorbs fairly well into skin (no piling)- Good for traveling b/c designCONS:- As with MOST overnight masks I’ve used, this does NOT replace a heavy/thick moisturizer- On only one night out of the 2 weeks, I had a reaction to the product and had to wash it off (skin felt tingly/like it was burning)- Strong smell (perfectly fine for me, but may be a con for those w sensitive skin)My overall review: If you have sensitive skin and react to scents, stay away from this product as it can definitely irritate your skin. Besides that, if you travel and want a nicely designed product and if this mask is within your budget, it’s not a bad option. The cooling effect of the product feels great, and contrary to other reviewers, it did not feel greasy in the morning.

I walked up to a employee asking for a sample of the Drunk Elephant BabyFacial to see if the high reviews held water. I explained to her how my skin is extremely sensitive and I have only tried physical natural exfoliating scrubs like Olehenriksen walnut scrub. She explained to me that finding the right chemical peel is crucial to skin type. And with mine being so sensitive, I was using the wrong one. Apparently the scrub I was using causes micro tears in the skin and can lead to more dryness and wrinkles! She said Drunk Elephant may be too strong for me and lead me to the Peter Thomas Roth section. She grabbed this silver bottle and asked to see my hand. She cleansed my hand and dried it and started rubbing this product on in a nice even layer. She talked to me more about the ingredients while this stuff sat on my hand for about 2 minutes and then said “Now watch.“ My jaw hit the floor. She was literally wiping clumps of dead skin off the back of my hand. The proof was incredible! I compared it to my other hand after she rinsed it with water and I could see the results after 1 application. I walked to the checkout with a bottle in hand immediately. I just used it for the first time on my face and wow...just wow! No redness, no irritation, just visibly much better looking skin. Soft and smooth and GLOWING!

Zero complaints, it was moisturizing and totally worth the money. No weird aftertaste on your lips. In December 2021, I ran out of peach tea. I ordered the Gummy Bear one (the regular gummy bear- not the BTS version). I hate it! It smells lovely and sweet but I can taste it (just from being on my lips- I’m not licking it or anything weird as I am an adult lol). It tastes like straight chemicals just “yuck” taste on my lips. Again, the smell is fine but I cannot get over the taste. I barely have used it, whereas the peach tea one I’d use 30x a day lol I was obsessed. Idk why there is a difference between the two, I no longer have the peach tea box and the jar itself has the exact same description between the two. Also, I don’t have like an over sensitive taste buds or something, I’m pretty immune to lightly scented or flavored things lol so I really don’t know why this is so bad.

"This is such a satisfying moisturizer. I have used this for about a week now, and in combination with some other products, this has aided in making my skin feel so smooth, look very hydrated, and look so healthy! I am very impressed with this product. It does have a mild earthy and “mushroomy” scent - it doesn’t bother me, and it dissipates shortly after application and sinking into the skin. It applies very softly and instantly feels hydrating. It is not greasy, oily, or slippery. The cream is not super thick, but it does have a nice, luxurious texture. The container is heavy and glass; it does seem like a small amount, but you do not need much of the product at all. I use a very small dot on each of my cheeks, one in my forehead, and one on my chin - and that amount is plenty to smooth out evenly on my face. This product will last me quite a while.

"This moisturizer is good, just not so dramatic. I first tried the gel formula for oily skin and it was WONDERFUL until it incredibly clogged my pores after a few days of usage and made my skin look textured thanks to the ridiculous amount of Dimethicone in it. Based on that, I quickly switched to this thinking it will have similar effect but without those silicones only to realize that it has good but kinda average effects. I only use it as a primer now but it does not really do that much for moisture. I love Clinique as a brand so much and it pains me that this just did not work for me. Also, the ingredients are kinda off and they don’t need to add THREE different colours. There is no need for unnecessary chemicals in a daily moisturizer. I will be kind to my skin and skip this product for a better moisturizer.",0.0,2,moisturizer good dramatic first try gel formula oily skin wonderful incredibly clog pore day usage make skin look textured thanks ridiculous amount dimethicone base quickly switch think similar effect without silicone realize good kinda average effect use primer really much moisture love clinique brand much pain work also ingredients kinda dont need add three different colour need unnecessary chemical daily moisturizer kind skin skip product well moisturizer

To do this I literally just put it on as a moisturizer and leave it on and my skin looks healthy all day (I would say though it probably doesn’t absorb fast enough to do this under makeup).

"I started using this after beginning treatment for acne at a dermatology clinic so I wasn’t sure how this would work for my combination skin that tends to run on the oily side. For reference, I was using clindamycin gel and tretinoin. So I needed good moisturizer to help counter the drying retinoid. As soon as I apply this cream after patch testing to be sure I didn’t have any reactions, I was pleasantly surprised by how it just sank into my skin and felt so light. I’ve been using it for a month and my skin has just been so soft ever since starting.I continued using this product for about a month and it has been such a surprise because my skin has just been so soft ever since I started using it.

Honestly, this product has changed my view of cleansers for good - you don’t need to strip your skin of every last ounce of oil and moisture to feel and actually be clean. Now, I will say if you wear a bit more makeup daily, you may want to consider this guy as a second cleanse rather than a primary cleanser because it is really gentle; however, I don’t wear much makeup and when I do I double cleanse anyway so this bad boy has easily become one of my favorite, tried-and-true products.",1.0,5,okay full disclosure first buy cleanser really eh felt like wasnt really clean skin skin actually still felt hydrate use use feeling like spent day desert without sip water postcleanse didnt realize magic green goo honestly product change view cleanser good dont need strip skin every last ounce oil moisture feel actually clean say wear bit makeup daily may want consider guy second cleanse rather primary cleanser really gentle however dont wear much makeup double cleanse anyway bad boy easily become one favorite triedandtrue product

I wasn’t necessarily either impressed or underwhelmed by this mask. I really like physical exfoliation for when my skin is feeling extra grimy.

"This is a great cleansing balm - definitely a fantastic affordable option for seasoned cleansing balm/oil users, or anyone wanting to try them out.  My only critique would be that it feels little grainy when you first smooth it on, and it takes a little longer to wash off than other similar products.  It also feels a bit heavier than the K-beauty cleansing balms I usually use.  That being said, this removes all of my makeup and SPF, even more stubborn mascaras, without harsh rubbing, and it emulsifies pretty well with a bit of water. I like that it is a balm in a squeezy tube, as it makes it much easier to use than traditional pot-style packaging. I like to keep this one in my shower to use after workouts, beach days, or if I decide to remove makeup in the shower.  Just be sure to use first thing before getting your hands and face wet, and follow up with a water-based cleanser :) Definitely a great value product, and I’ve gone through a couple of tubes, and would buy again! Also - I have oily-leaning, acne prone skin and am in my early 30s - this product does not cause me to break out.  I love and generally use K-beauty cleansing balms and oils, and am always on the hunt for similar, but more affordable and accessible products.",1.0,4,great cleanse balm definitely fantastic affordable option season cleanse balmoil user anyone want try critique would feel little grainy first smooth take little long wash similar product also feel bit heavy kbeauty cleanse balm usually use say remove makeup spf even stubborn mascara without harsh rub emulsifies pretty well bit water like balm squeezy tube make much easy use traditional potstyle packaging like keep one shower use workout beach day decide remove makeup shower sure use first thing get hand face wet follow waterbased cleanser definitely great value product ive go couple tube would buy also oilyleaning acne prone skin early product cause break love generally use kbeauty cleanse balm oil always hunt similar affordable accessible product

Small whiteheads began popping up, particularly around my mouth and on my chin. I stopped using the product and, sure enough, the spots went away.

"I’ve been reading all the negative reviews and I’m in shock because I actually love this product. I bought the entire set (cc cream, powder, and brush) and I found that it worked amazing for me. I have combination skin and dark acne scarring. I found the product had amazing coverage for being just a CC cream. I applied the foundation with a brush and it blended well. I think the problem is that it does set a bit quickly, so working in smaller sections (versus dotting it all over your face) will work better. Once it sets after applying it, it IS very matte. And if it feels too matte, you can go over it with a beauty blender! It’s not patchy or streaky. It is a bit heavier feeling compared to their original CC cream (which I also own), but it’s not unbearable and feels much better once you spray some setting spray or mist. (You also don’t need to set this foundation with powder with how matte it is. But I do. And it layered with powder nicely). This lasted me all day! (Wore it for 9 hours. No touch ups!). I WILL say that the color of this versus the original CC is slightly different in the tube. Once applied it looks the same (or at least the shade medium tan does). I do recommend this foundation based on my experience with it!!!

Maybe my skin just didn’t enjoy this product but the more I used it, the worse my pimples got and the more irritated my skin felt. My skin did feel smooth the rest of the night but it also felt super dry even after I used my nighttime moisturizer which usually doesn’t make me feel dry at all. Also the immediate glow faded quickly and did leave a bit of a tacky finish which did go away after applying my moisturizer. Last but certainly not least, this product is STUPID expensive.

Does make your skin feel smoother and cleaner. I did feel like I had to use a lot of product though. I wondered if the white balls were actually skin or if it was a gimmick with the formula. Did some research into that and the sources said there is an ingredient that balls up which they claim takes the dead skin with it.

I got this as a part of a set with 4 other minis. Disappointed. It’s not gel like at all it’s pretty watery if you ask me.

And felt some burning on my cheeks when toning I have an oily T but dry cheeks so I think this stuff just dried them too much after only 3 days of using it.

I also found that instead of feeling hydrated after applying the product, it made my skin feel even more dry?

"You might be thinking: will adding sunscreen to my morning & face every few hours really make that much of a difference? I’m here to tell you: it absolutely will. My skin is on the dry/oily side depending on the time of year- but in the winter my skin wants to match the intensity of the frigid cold snow and crumble away like that granola bar you forgot is in the bottom of your bag as a safety snack. It’s not cute friends, not cute. The unseen sunscreen revitalizes my skin & lets me have peace of mind that it’s protected from not only the blazing rays of the sun- but also adds a little extra punch of hydration so that I know that despite my genetics- there’s an improved chance of my skin looking younger for longer. I cannot recommend this product enough! I apply it after washing, toning, adding my serum, and moisturizing to really lock in the moisture. It’s comfortable under makeup & doesn’t affect the texture of my BB cream. I use Supergoop!’s mineral powder to reapply sunscreen after a few hours if I am wearing makeup- otherwise if I’m not I’ll slather this on again and hit my face with a lil setting spray to feel fancy. It’s worth the money! I’m inconsistent (despite my dedication to not look like a dried up raisin) so the full sized version will last me two months. As an added bonus: You can ALSO recycle the bottle after you’ve used all of the product so you aren’t contributing to landfills while trying to keep ya skin fresh.

I never buy any cream twice as I always feel there is something better for my aging wrinkling, large pore, dry but easily clogged skin. This is fantastic. I have now bought it for the third time. Do not buy the gel version it is not moisturizing enough and I had to return it. It may make your skin a touch red so sunscreen is a must as with any vitamin C product but I realize there is nothing like this for making my skin look WAY younger. Wrinkles pretty much disappear almost on the first use. The nice thing is you can try it in the store and not have to order it to know if it works for you. I got a small sample of it and when I put it on my husband said “wow what did you do?“ I’m not making any of this up. It sounds like a too good to be true review but I have literally wasted thousands on creams. I don’t want to mention that it made me slightly red because then you might keep looking but honestly the touch of red is sooooo worth it to be 10 years younger. People need to try this. I hope this helps you. I wasted so much money at creams at sephora before finding this, drunk elephant no, squalane oil themed creams no, clinique redness no, clarins oil no, josie maran whipped pretty excellent but not as good as this, origins planscriptions is garbage, anyway too many to list but you get the idea.

I’m not sure why companies in 2022 are electing to add in extra (non-natural) fragrances. They can always lightly improve the scent with plant extracts, or just leave it non-scented.

"Ok so I’m not going to lie, my skin looks amazing. I’ll be the first to admit, I’m very new to the whole AHA/BHA acid life. And I’m the interest of being totally honest, I can feel most acids on my skin because of the ingredients and my skin is not at all used to acids. Other estheticians have told me it takes some getting used to if it wasn’t already in the routine. I was someone using regular toner but I can say that my skin is requiring more due to aging. Off rip, the toner kind of burned the first couple of times I put it on with one of those times being right after I exfoliated which the bottle said not to do but I didn’t read it until afterwards so reading is fundamental. This product is already an exfoliant so using one prior to putting this on will burn. I can’t stress that enough. It definitely gives an instant glow which I thought was very unique as most toners I’ve used mattify the skin. It also didn’t leave my skin feeling so dry after application. I tried the toner by itself and underneath my makeup and loved both. I can definitely see all the praise worthy claims and the improvements in my skin from using this product.

"The products itself, if you just guess by the name sounds like a facial oil. It is actually marketed in the instructions to be used as an essence, before a serum.

Very very flowery, it sticks around and is overall not what I’m looking for to add into my routine. Ford this price I would have thought it would be more hydrating.

"I originally got this as a trial size in a kit that I purchased from Farmacy and I I was surprised at how much I liked it.

My guess is that most people will prefer this as a nighttime moisturizer but I have actually worn it during the day and it doesn’t alter the application or finish of my makeup whatsoever and actually almost seems to make everything apply better. There’s no added fragrance to it although it has just a very light natural no that dissipates immediately.Because I enjoyed the trial size, I actually ordered a full size ( which conveniently has a little metal spatula that magnetizes to the lid of the jar) and because such a small amount is needed per usage I know that it’s going to last a long time so I don’t feel bad about paying a little bit more for it.",1.0,4,originally get trial size kit purchase farmacy surprise much like initially little bit worried scoop jar literally feel like butter interest formula though take small amount cover entire face product even though seem though thick melt skin somehow doesnt feel heavy incredibly moisturize think go absolutely perfect fall winter month skin normally get incredibly dry guess people prefer nighttime moisturizer actually worn day doesnt alter application finish makeup whatsoever actually almost seem make everything apply good there add fragrance although light natural dissipates immediatelybecause enjoy trial size actually order full size conveniently little metal spatula magnetize lid jar small amount need per usage know go last long time dont feel bad pay little bit

I’m typically a fan of Glow Recipe products but this one isn’t my favorite. It has a thick gel based texture which I just may not be used to in a moisturizer. When I first used it I wasn’t sure I noticed any plumping results. The next time I did before/after photos and did notice a difference but it was in the morning so it could also just be from waking up.

"Yep, I can confirm that the formula has changed. This makes me really sad as good genes was my favorite splurge. After reading reviews I was concerned with buying a full sized so I spent my points on a sample size.. i was unbothered by the original formulas scent, it smelled like lemongrass to me & the scent didn’t linger very long. This new formulation INDEED smells like straight up lemon. Not like the old stuff. I have the old formulation right here to compare & it’s not the same by a long shot. I get no tingle, and the texture is much more lotion like- but absorbs really fast, so I’m having to apply way way way more. This sample size will prob be good for two applications... if it were the old formula I think it would’ve gotten me at least a week and a half. Very bummed out. I just wish they’d be honest and come right out & let everyone know that they changed the formulas. I’ll finish this tiny tube out, as long as i don’t have any adverse reactions.

"I was lucky enough to find one of these in my local Marshall’s the other day. I’ve been wanting to try this product for awhile because I got a sample of the sleep mask in the apple scent and was absolutely head over heels for it. Last year I bought four tubes of the Bite agave lip mask prior to their reformulation which is the reason why I have pushed off buying the Laneige lip balm. I have to say that I actually like this more than the laneige sleep mask and the bite agave mask simply because it’s in a squeeze tube and I don’t need to use my fingers to apply the products (the sample lip mask doesn’t come with the cute little spatula). I’ve found that the lip sleep mask and the lip balm have very similar consistency and lasting power. I have applied the lip balm prior to going to bed and still wake up with it on my lips (I also had the same experience with the sleep mask but not with the old formula bite beauty lip agave mask). In the end, if you’ve been wanting to try the sleep mask but have been apprehensive just get this lip balm. Don’t get me wrong the sleep mask is absolutely amazing and if this product wasn’t available I would be tell you to get that instead.

It does NOT smell like Vapor Rub as someone else pointed out (girl have you ever even smelled Vicks lol?) However it DOES have a very strong fragrance.

Like a lot of their moisturizing products, a little goes a very long way, and applying too much can feel sticky. As said, the mist on this is extremely fine, probably the best of any spray bottle I’ve found. I use it mostly when I’m traveling, because of how easy it is to spray and go, and the full size still fits the airline guidelines for carry on liquids. I also use it when I’m ill and don’t want to put my hands in my moisturizer jars. It smells really nice, without being over powering.

There are more advanced oil blends on the market that address multiple skin concerns and offer multiple benefits to the skin besides just hydration. Don’t be fooled by the word Luxury, either.

"I initially loved this moisturizer, as it has the perfect texture (not too thick but you can instantly feel an added layer of moisture on your skin). My skin felt nice and hydrated for about the first week, but then I developed super dry red patches along both sides of my mouth.

"At 23 years old I randomly started breaking out with severe, uncontrollable, cystic acne. My cheeks, chin, and forehead were constantly covered with big bumps that I just could not cover. Although I was not picking or popping my pimples (as instructed by my doctor) every blemish would leave a red or purple scar that showed thru every full coverage foundation and concealer that I tried. I was looking for a new exfoliator when an employee at Sephora recommended Dennis Gross. I was hesitant at first because of the price and because it was for all skin types and not specifically for acne. However, after just 2 weeks of using these peels (I only use every other day because my skin is a little sensitive) my acne scars have faded significantly and almost all of my breakouts are gone! In addition to that, my skin is brighter, pores are smaller, and my skin tone is starting to even out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, regarding their skin ailment (starting out every other day then switching to once a day, if need be). I honestly just can’t believe how much this product has helped my skin recover.",1.0,5,year old randomly start break severe uncontrollable cystic acne cheek chin forehead constantly cover big bump could cover although pick pop pimple instruct doctor every blemish would leave red purple scar show thru every full coverage foundation concealer try look new exfoliator employee sephora recommend dennis gross hesitant first price skin type specifically acne however week use peel use every day skin little sensitive acne scar fade significantly almost breakouts go addition skin brighter pore small skin tone start even would definitely recommend anyone regard skin ailment start every day switch day need honestly cant believe much product help skin recover
"You have to understand that I have tried so many chapsticks, lip balms, lip scrubs, blah blah blah that it’s not funny.  I was walking around Sephora one day and saw this and wondered if it could help with my chronic dry and peeling lips.  I skipped on purchasing it, but kept it on my radar.  When Sephora launced their Holiday gift sets, this was one of the items highlighted, so I decided to read some of the reviews, and I’m glad I did.  You guys, this lip mask is life-changing and the berry scent is everything.  It doesn’t have flavor which makes sense because then we’d lick it off and it wouldn’t work.  I’m not always a good girl about brushing my teeth before I go to bed, but I tell myself that if I do, this lip sleeping mask is my reward.  If I don’t brush at night or at least floss and use mouthwash, then I’m not allowed to have any lip sleeping mask.  Well guess what? This mask is so good that I’m either brushing or mouthwashing EVERY NIGHT just so I can put this on.  It comes with a silicone applicator and you just scrap up a little and rub on your lips.  It’s so thick and lovely that in the morning my lips are still shiny and coated with the maske.  They are smooth, soft, and chap free.  I’ve never ever used anything like this, and I’ll never be without it again.  So glad I read the reviews and purchased.",1.0,5,understand try many chapsticks lip balm lip scrubs blah blah blah funny walk around sephora one day saw wonder could help chronic dry peel lip skip purchase keep radar sephora launced holiday gift set one item highlight decide read review im glad guy lip mask lifechanging berry scent everything doesnt flavor make sense wed lick wouldnt work im always good girl brush teeth go bed tell lip sleep mask reward dont brush night least floss use mouthwash im allow lip sleeping mask well guess mask good im either brush mouthwashing every night put come silicone applicator scrap little rub lip thick lovely morning lip still shiny coated maske smooth soft chap free ive never ever use anything like ill never without glad read review purchase

And it pills BAD. It doesn’t work in combination with the niacinamide drops for me either, although not as bad as the mask. I follow the directions for all products but they just aren’t working in combination with each other for me. this cream on its own is good, I can see it lasting me way longer than the pink juice does, but I honestly don’t think I will end up repurchasing since I am having problems combining it with my other favourite glow recipe products, but I don’t dislike it enough to return it either.

"It is gentle, but the “pore-tight” feeling is more of a sticky film than anything else. Moisturizer application afterwards is rough, makeup is near impossible. The smell is about as strong as other fragranced toners, but for the $$$ I’d def get something else.",0.0,2,gentle poretight feel sticky film anything else moisturizer application afterwards rough makeup near impossible smell strong fragranced toner id def get something else

"I received this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox for my honest review, It was a sample size of .17 fl.oz or 5ml, much bigger than the samples for the serum and eye cream. This cream has a very strong chemical smell to it but seems to fade as it sinks into your skin. It’s a medium to thick weight cream, but easy to rub in with your hands or facial massager. I used this cream a few times, day and night routines; the first time I used it was with the same brand/line name of serum and eye cream and it made my face really sticky! Next time I used this cream it was with the same brand/line of eye cream but I switched the serum and my face felt smooth, NOT sticky. Something to do with the combination of this serum and cream/moisturiser for my skin just does not work, makes my face feel all sticky every time. But using them individually and/or with other products/brands seem to be fine. In the end I would not recommend this cream/moisturiser based on smell and that it just doesn’t seem to work well in the product line.",0.0,2,receive freeproduct trywithtopbox honest review sample size floz ml much big sample serum eye cream cream strong chemical smell seem fade sink skin medium thick weight cream easy rub hand facial massager use cream time day night routine first time use brandline name serum eye cream make face really sticky next time use cream brandline eye cream switch serum face felt smooth sticky something combination serum creammoisturiser skin work make face feel sticky every time use individually andor productsbrands seem fine end would recommend creammoisturiser base smell doesnt seem work well product line
"I was sent a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review.Disclosure: My sample was only a mere ..75oz/5ml teeny jar, so was only able to use for about 10 days (def not the 4 weeks most of their testing was done for, certainly not over my entire face/neck). Results may be better/longer lasting with long term use than my brief experience.I have VERY dry skin and their “indulgent textured“ formula is rich, i.e. extremely thick -a little does NOT go a long way. Scent on the “mature“ side, not great. Non-greasy, absorbed fast, no blemishes, it cleared up some dry flakes but my face just didn’t FEEL very moisturized or smooth after. However, immediate results were seen esp under-eye. Fresh, brightened and tightened (similar to -more affordable, just as effective- TF’s Plump & Prime). Bags/discolor lightened and appearance of wrinkles lessoned. BUT, this effect did not last. Maybe a few hours after applying in the am. Overnight a slight fresh look upon waking, but short-lasting. You’d have to apply every few hours to keep this up.Due to the consistency, I think a jar would be used up very quick, making the price (64-120$) not worth it. The refills are a nice option though.This may better benefit more mature and/or dry/sensitive skin. If you have the cash, give it a shot. Hopefully it may work better with long-term use. Me, I’ll be sticking to the cheaper, equally -if not better- options:).",0.0,3,sent complimentary sample exchange honest reviewdisclosure sample mere ozml teeny jar able use day def week test do certainly entire faceneck result may betterlonger last long term use brief experiencei dry skin indulgent textured formula rich ie extremely thick little go long way scent mature side great nongreasy absorb fast blemish clear dry flake face didnt feel moisturize smooth however immediate result see esp undereye fresh brighten tighten similar affordable effective tfs plump prime bagsdiscolor lighten appearance wrinkle lessoned effect last maybe hour apply overnight slight fresh look upon wake shortlasting youd apply every hour keep updue consistency think jar would use quick make price worth refill nice option thoughthis may better benefit mature andor drysensitive skin cash give shoot hopefully may work good longterm use ill stick cheap equally good option
