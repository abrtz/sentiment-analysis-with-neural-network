Sentiment Analysis with a Neural Network

This repository contains the notebooks to build my own neural network to perform an NLP task. The task chosen is sentiment analysis.

The neural network was built following the steps described in the book Make Your Own Neural Network by Tariq Rashid (2016).

Notebooks 01 and 02 contain the code from the abovementioned book to create a NN for image recognition.

Notebooks 03 and 04 contain the code to explore the dataset to perform the sentiment analysis task.

Notebooks 05, 06 and 07 contain the code with the experiments carried out for the NLP task:
* 05: sentiment classification with a BoW vector counting bigrams with a minimum frequency of 300.
* 06: sentiment classification with a padded vector created from an n-gram BoW mapping the indices of words appearing in the vector to those appearing in each text.
* 07: sentiment classification with a word embedding padded vector.
